## Description
&nbsp;Jeux Olympiques 2024 - LutteDescription:&nbsp;For the countdown to the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, Monnaie de Paris celebrates the road to the games through Paris as well as its own heritage. 100 years after the 1924 Games, the French capital is once again hosting the Summer Games. This is an event with international resonance, gradually building in intensity in the years leading up to the event, culminating in 2024 with the issue of two commemorative two-euro coins dedicated to the Olympic Games. The design represents Hercules, a national figure and icon of French numismatics, practicing antique wrestling with Notre- Dame’s Chimera, in reference to the Olympic Games of the Ancient era. Both wrestlers are depicted in the foreground in front of Notre-Dame Cathedral. In the background, an athletics track in which the emblem of Paris 2024 is inserted on the left side, is represented. The yeardate, the RF indication, as well as the mintmarks are inserted on the athletics track. The coin’s outer ring bears the 12 stars of the European flag.Issuing volume:&nbsp;510 000 coinsIssuing date:&nbsp;January 2024
